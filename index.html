	  <h1>The Mysterious Marble Maiden<br>The gaze of this colourful lady can tell a thousand stories of our ancient past</h1>
	  <img src="plaatjes/face.jpg" style="width:100px;" >
	  <p>For 2,500 long year, this girl – or ‘kore’ in ancient Greek – with her mysterious smile did not see any daylight. Together with 14 of her sisters, she lay buried in one of the many dark clefts of the Acropolis rock in Athens, in the immediate vicinity of the later and current Erechtheion temple. Only in the nineteenth century the story of her discovery began: on a beautiful day in March 1886, amidst a <a href="https://www.gettyimages.nl/detail/illustratie/king-george-i-visiting-the-acropolis-where-statues-stock-afbeelding/926790960" target="_blank">crowd of curious onlookers</a>, the not-so-final resting place of these korai was opened. A true marvel, since most of the other statues of their time have been lost. We have been lucky that these korai remained carefully hidden for so long. 
	  </p>
	  <p>But how did Peplos Kore - for that is her actual name - end up there?</p> 
	  <div id="text" style="display:none">
	  <p>That is a story of war and political strife, of one of the ancient fights between the Greeks and the Persians. It is the one that ended with the Persian destruction and burning of Kore’s <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4zidtrhQRg target="_blank">Acropolis home in 480 BC.</a> Among the sounds of axe clashing and the smell and heat of raging fires, Peplos Kore and her sisters were pulled from their high bases, smashed in many pieces and left where they lay, later to be buried by the mourning Athenians. They were no longer the delights they were supposed to be.  
	  </p>
	  <p>For Peplos Kore really <em>was</em> a delight (or <em>agalmata</em>). That brings us to the third of Kore’s many stories: a story of the colourfulness of the past, one of which only traces can still be seen – if you look carefully. With these many colours, the ancients hoped to bring joy to their powerful gods and goddesses, who roamed every part of the earth. In Athens, the chief-protectress was Athena, and her home was the Acropolis. Maybe, this Kore was a sacred gift to this goddess, and her lost arm maybe once held a fruit, a bird, or a flower. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Or was she something else? At first glance, Kore is just a simple, charming, young girl, but what if this story of religion, gods and goddesses can be extended to include her? What if the <em>peplos</em> – a garment for young girls – she wears is actually another piece of clothing, something much more… divine? Maybe she was a goddess herself, a copy of an actual sacred idol!
	  </p>
	  <p>We may never know all her secrets. But we <em>can </em>try, and we will.
	  </p>
	  <p>So, what <em>is</em> clear, is that the Peplos Kore was – and is – not only a joy reserved for goddesses, but also for us. Her mysterious (Archaic) smile, the slight turn of her head, the lifting of her arm, the sinking costume between her legs, and her almost forgotten colours still give us a sense of liveliness we can all enjoy. In this sense, Kore is <em>the</em> symbol of a culture on the move, the beginning of Greek sculptors trying to bring our living and breathing world into art. No wonder the statues of later Greek times – the classical times most known to us – became so full of life and motion.
	  </p>
	  <p>All this gives just a glimpse of the depth of the many stories Peplos Kore can tell us.
